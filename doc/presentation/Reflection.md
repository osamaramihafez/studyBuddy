What worked well
-----------------
Using one language to work on everything allowed us to work more efficiently. 
The use of the MERN stack simplified access to the database and translation to the front end. This was especially beneficial to our three-tier structure which requires the presentation tier not to be in direct communication with the data tier. 
We also used discord which was useful for our meetings and for us to bounce ideas off of each other without having to all meet physically. 
Using the route and react componentry allowed our app to be modular, this is to say, there were little to no coupling, most components could operate on their own. This allowed us to easily shift and change the application to fit our expectations and needs. 
Additionally, our components also followed the single responsibility principle, this also ended up helping us with decoupling and once again allowing us to easily shift and change the application to fit our expectations and needs. 

What didn't work well
-----------------
For us, most of the things that did not work well for us had to do with stories and sprint planning.
JIRA was useful, but it was hard to track what everyone was doing. Jira may be useful for a more experienced team, there was a learning curve with the software, especially when it came to following particular processes that were outlined by the rubric and handout. 
Secondly, our team was not sure what to do when we decided that certain stories were not necessary for our product, as they were not useful. To work around this, what we should have done is make it clear what our minimum viable product was and then work towards that instead of building as much of the application as possible and hoping for the best.
Thirdly, in our planning for each sprint, we did not understand why we should not have dependent stories in each backlog. Unfortunately, we found this out late into the project, with some better understanding this could have been avoided.

Changes to the workflow process we would implement
---------------------------------------------------

In terms of changes that we’d like to make, there are a few that we’ve learned during the development process as well as some that were learned from research.
Firstly, we’d implement the change mentioned earlier, less or no dependent stories per sprint. In addition to this, we learned a lot more about how to use the JIRA Agile application, as a result, we believe that we could use that more effectively and according to the agile guidelines.
Something interesting that may aid us in the development process is development for testing using systems such as travis CI (continuous integration). This would allow us to create unit tests that would run every commit and merge. It would take a lot of time out of debugging for us as we would understand where the bug is in the code instead of having to sift through thousands of lines of code.
