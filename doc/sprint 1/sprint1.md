What was the goal for sprint one? 
In sprint 1, we wanted to lay down the architecture for our web application. We wanted to be able to use the task manager aspect as an API that could be used on Postman. We also wanted to create front-end (React) components that will call on the API to authenticate users. 
Spikes
The first major spike for us is other course work, the sprint is happening during a very academically heavy time for all members. So ideal days are very limited for everyone. 
The second major spike for us was learning the new technologies associated with the sprint. That includes MongoDB, Express, React, and NodeJS. This also lowered productivity but we do not believe this will an issue in later sprints.
Team capacity
Our team capacity per sprint is 72
