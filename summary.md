What is Study Buddy?

Studdy buddy is a task-manager web app built with MERN Stack. It is a site where people can
both manage their daily tasks as well as use proven study techniques, in our case the Pomodoro Technique, to streamline a user's studying.

What are our key principles?

Our goals for this application include building a free-to-use application for the general public. The biggest pushback when it comes to applications is the pay-wall that developers put up. Making a free, public task managing app with a Pomodoro timer, the two together can help people focus and finish their tasks.
