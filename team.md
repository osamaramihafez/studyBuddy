Meeting Preperation

The topic of the meeting is known before hand.
No preperation is needed. 

Version Control

Commit as often as needed, but please stick to your branch.
Make sure your changes are meaningful

Commit messages need to specify what was changed in the files that 
were commited and what user story it is associated with.

Roles and Division of Work

There will be 2 divisions for the application. Specifically, Front-end and Back-end

Front-end work will include any work that has to do with the React
Back-end work will include any code that has to do with routing, databasing.

To ensure proper the front-end team understands what the back-end team is doing, documentation will be written on the requests.

Submitting Sprint Deliverables and Software

Every submission will be checked by Travis CI before any subsequent decisions are made.

2 weeks before the sprint due date, the team would like at least 40% of the features to be implemented.  

1 week before the sprint due date, the team would like at least 70% of the features to be implemented.

3 days before the sprint due date, the team will do a code review to make sure everyone is on the same page

Contingency Planning

If a team member drops out, we will equally distribute their responsibilites on the rest of the team members.

If a team member is academically dishonest or does not pull their weight, the group leader will report it to the appropriate authority.
